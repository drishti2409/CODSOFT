# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains code and data for predicting customer churn in a banking industry setting using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Dataset
 The dataset used in this project contains various customer features like Credit Score, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, Estimated Salary, and more. The objective was to build robust classification models to predict whether a customer will churn or remain active.
