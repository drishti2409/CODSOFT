# Credit Card Fraud Detection

The objective of the credit card fraud detection system,is to automatically identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The system aims to distinguish between legitimate transactions (normal) and fraudulent transactions (fraud) using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The credit card transaction dataset used in this project is loaded from a CSV file named 'creditcard.csv'. The dataset contains anonymized features related to credit card transactions, including transaction amount, time, and other relevant attributes.
